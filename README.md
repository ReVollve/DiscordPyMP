# DiscordPyMP
<a href="CHANGELOG.md">Changelog</a> <br>
A discord music bot for me and my friends.
I've written it in a way and chose my settings in a way I like it the best. 
The coding style is definitely not the best, 
but it works for me and I use this bot over all other bots on the web.
<br>
I included some features that me and my friends like to use.
For example:
- optional implementation of self-made ads
- Youtube search, links and playlist support
- Three different loop modes
- [TODO] local playlist saver
- [TODO] voice recognition
## Disclaimer
#### This bot requires a look into config files before starting up
#### This bot is not complete and will still throw some errors and requires restarting by force

## Configuration:
#### /bot.json
You will have to take a look in this file and change the parameters to your liking
#### /lang/*.json
You can create custom lang files. But they have to match the standard format.<br>
There is no tutorial for the standard format.
But you can still use the example english file /lang/en-en.json <br>

## PyPi requirements:
- PyNaCl
- discord.py
- yt-dlp

## Side requirements:
- opus
- ffmpeg
